/**
 * Repository rows store one `local_path` string, but the same checkout has two
 * spellings depending on which platform wrote the row: a WSL process writes
 * `/mnt/e/cs/devsys/...` while a Windows process writes `E:\CS\devsys\...`.
 * A shared database can therefore hold a path that the current process cannot open.
 *
 * Translating at read time keeps both environments working and is a no-op for a
 * path that already matches the current platform, so single-platform use is unchanged.
 * The stored value is never rewritten, which is what makes this safe for concurrent
 * sessions on the other platform.
