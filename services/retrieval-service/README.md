# SeekDB Retrieval Service

This service is the production `CodeSearchPort` boundary for ForeXplore. It
stores code-symbol documents in [SeekDB](https://github.com/oceanbase/seekdb)
and exposes the stable workflow search contract over HTTP.

## Retrieval modes

- `semantic`: HNSW cosine-distance search over dense embeddings.
- `structure`: SeekDB full-text search, constrained to the target symbol kind.
- `hybrid`: parallel vector and full-text queries followed by weighted
  reciprocal-rank fusion and contract-aware reranking.

Each mode retrieves a broader, bounded candidate pool before final reranking,
which keeps small result sets useful when the index contains many repositories.

The schema uses SeekDB's `VECTOR`, `VECTOR INDEX ... TYPE=hnsw`,
`FULLTEXT INDEX`, and `ORDER BY cosine_distance(...) APPROXIMATE` features.
All query values and filters are parameterized; only validated SQL identifiers
and generated vector hex literals are interpolated.

## Start locally

SeekDB's embedded library is currently available for Linux and Apple Silicon,
not native Windows. Docker or a remote SeekDB instance is therefore the
portable development option.

```text
docker compose -f services/retrieval-service/docker-compose.yml up -d
copy services\retrieval-service\.env.example services\retrieval-service\.env
npm install
npm run schema --workspace @forexplore/retrieval-service
npm run index:corpus --workspace @forexplore/retrieval-service -- --replace
npm run dev:retrieval
```

In another terminal:

```text
copy apps\workflow-web\.env.example apps\workflow-web\.env
npm run dev
```

The service listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` by default. Check both layers:

```text
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
```

The sample Docker image is for development/testing. Use a managed or properly
operated SeekDB deployment for production.

## Embeddings

`SEEKDB_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=hash` is the default. It performs deterministic
token and character-trigram feature hashing, needs no model download, and is
appropriate for integration smoke tests. It is not a replacement for a
semantic embedding model.

Set `SEEKDB_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai` with an OpenAI-compatible embeddings URL,
API key, model, and matching `SEEKDB_VECTOR_DIMENSION` for production-quality
semantic retrieval. A table's vector dimension cannot be changed in place:
use a new table or rebuild it when changing models/dimensions.

## Index input

By default, `index:corpus` scans both `fixtures/code-corpus` and
`fixtures/translation-datasets`. It extracts class, method, and function
symbols from TypeScript, Python, Java, Rust, and Go sources and indexes the
resulting documents. Both `manifest.json` and `dataset-manifest.json`
repositories are discovered. The intentionally incomplete C# translation
skeleton is not treated as a reusable implementation.

Pass `--replace` to clear the dedicated code-symbol table first. To override
the defaults, pass one or more explicit corpus roots after `--`.

The lower-level `index` command accepts UTF-8 JSON Lines. Each line follows this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-symbol-id",
  "title": "Cache.getOrLoad",
  "repository": "owner/repository",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "language": "TypeScript",
  "kind": "function",
  "path": "src/cache.ts",
  "signature": "getOrLoad(key: string): Promise<Value>",
  "summary": "TTL cache with request coalescing",
  "preview": "async function getOrLoad(...) { ... }",
  "dependencies": [],
  "compatibility": [],
  "risks": [],
  "content": "Optional additional searchable implementation text"
}
```

The indexer upserts documents in batches and calls
`dbms_index_manager.refresh()` so newly indexed vectors are immediately
searchable on supported SeekDB versions.

## HTTP API

- `GET /health` checks the SeekDB connection.
- `POST /v1/search` accepts `SearchRequest` from `@forexplore/contracts` and
  returns `{ "candidates": SearchCandidate[] }`.

Set `candidateLanguages` on `SearchRequest` when the downstream adapter only
supports specific source languages. The constraint is applied in SeekDB and
checked again before candidates are returned. For example, the Java-to-C#
pipeline sends `candidateLanguages: ["Java"]` while keeping the target
language as `CSharp`.

Set `VITE_RETRIEVAL_API_URL` in the web app to activate the real adapter. If the
variable is absent, the original mock search adapter remains active.
