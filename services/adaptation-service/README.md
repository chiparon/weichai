# Adaptation Service (Module 3)

Java → C# code adaptation: target-context analysis → planned translation → compile validation → auto-fix → backfill.

## Analyzer workflow

`ContextCollector` first reads a bounded, repository-scoped view of the C# target
file, containing type, imports, sibling files, and textual references. `analyzer.ts`
compares that context with the Java candidate and produces a schema-validated
`AnalysisReport`.

The analyzer can also be called independently with `POST /v1/analyze`. Its response
contains both `report` and collected `context`; `/v1/adapt` stops before translation
when the report rejects a candidate or contains explicit `blockingIssues`.

## Analyzer-driven Translator Agent

The Translator now has a structured member-C entry point:

```ts
const result = await translateWithAnalysis(
  {
    candidateSource,
    targetContext,
    requirement,
    analysisReport,
  },
  { apiKey },
  signal,
);
```

The model receives target module context and `AnalysisReport v1` in a separate
system/user call. Its decision order is fixed to target contract, requirement,
analysis report, then candidate details. The response is parsed as a structured
`TranslationResult` containing generated code, mappings, completed plan steps,
and unresolved items.

Runtime guards reject Analyzer `reject` decisions, explicit blocking issues,
changed target signatures, omitted plan steps/mappings, and output that expands
into using/namespace/enclosing-type changes. The existing
`translateJavaToCSharp()` and `fixCompileErrors()` exports remain compatible for
the current HTTP adapter while the Analyzer and orchestration work lands.

Validator integration uses the reserved repair entry point:

```ts
const repaired = await repairTranslation(
  {
    ...translationInput,
    previousResult,
    validationFeedback,
  },
  { apiKey },
  signal,
);
```

A passing feedback result is idempotent and performs no model request. Failed
feedback must contain structured syntax, contract, dependency, or behavior
issues. Fixed member-C samples live in `testdata/translator-*.json`.

Ordinary `unresolved` observations remain visible to Translator and Validator but
do not stop translation. Analyzer uses `blockingIssues` only for questions that
cannot be implemented reliably from the current evidence.

## ReCodeAgent MCP migration

The repository includes a read-only stdio MCP server rewritten from the useful
subset of the MIT-licensed ReCodeAgent project. It preserves the analysis tools
needed here, adds Java/C# support, and confines all reads to the configured root:

- `get_directory_tree(path, print_dirs_only, max_depth)`
- `get_file_structure(language, file_path)`
- `definition(symbolName)`
- `references(symbolName, maxResults)`
- `read_file(path, maxChars)`
- `get_target_context(target)`

Build and start it with:

```bash
npm run build:adaptation
npm run mcp --workspace @forexplore/adaptation-service -- \
  fixtures/target-system/forexplore-csharp-workspace
```

`AdaptationAdapter` accepts only the `translate` strategy with a Java candidate
and a `C#` target. Unsupported language pairs are rejected before any LLM
request is made.

When `skeletonProjectPath` is configured, integration validation copies the
delivered C# skeleton to a temporary directory, replaces only the target
method, and runs `dotnet build`. The real workspace is never modified during
validation. Compiler errors drive at most three model repair attempts; a
missing compiler stops the repair loop and is reported as a warning.

The model endpoint and model name are loaded by `src/model-config.ts` so the
translator does not own provider configuration. `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` defaults to
`deepseek-v4-flash`; `DEEPSEEK_API_BASE` can override the compatible endpoint.
Callers must still pass the API key to `AdaptationAdapter`.

## Web demo quick start

The browser calls this service through `POST /v1/adapt`. The DeepSeek key stays
in this Node process; it is never included in the Vite environment or browser
bundle.

```bash
cp services/adaptation-service/.env.example services/adaptation-service/.env
# Edit the copied file and set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY.

# Required for real standalone and integrated C# validation. Under WSL the
# service also auto-detects C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe.
dotnet --version || '/mnt/c/Program Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe' --version

npm install
npm run dev:adaptation
```

In another terminal, start retrieval and Web together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The checked-in Web environment example points to `http://127.0.0.1:8788`.
Verify the adaptation service before the demo with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8788/health
```

The Web demo uses the real service only for Java method → C# method translation.
Backfill remains the Mock port, so clicking the final backfill action does not
change the delivered skeleton.

## Python POC

```powershell
# 5 hardcoded test cases
pip install openai
$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "sk-..."
python poc/translate_poc.py

# End-to-end: search API → translate → compile
python poc/e2e_pipeline.py
```

## Pipeline position

```
code-indexer (module 1) → retrieval-service (module 2) → adaptation-service (module 3)
                                                              ↑
                                              /v1/search → candidates → LLM → C#
```
